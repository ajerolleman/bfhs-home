CEO’S & PRINCIPAL’S MESSAGE
Let’s Go(oooo)!
Welcome back, Falcons! We are excited for the 2025-2026 school
year. There are so many achievements and accomplishments to
celebrate. From 94% of advanced placement students scoring a three
(3) or above, to competing in state championships, Franklin is truly
the flagship school!
At Franklin, our ultimate goal is to ensure our students are prepared
to be the best version of themselves. To do so, we foster an
environment that is inclusive and representative of our exceptional
students and community. Our school’s diversity is what makes Franklin such a special place. Uplifting
and elevating our students’ identities and academic promise is of the utmost importance.
As we transition into this amazing community and the upcoming school year, there are three areas of
strategic focus. To ensure Franklin is best positioned to support teaching and learning, our three
strategic priorities are:
● Increasing Our Academic Ranking,
● Improving Our Facilities, and
● Strengthening School Culture and Accountability
Achieving these priorities will take all of us - students, families, teachers, staff, and community.
Students, we encourage you to meet and exceed our expectations, academically and culturally.
Academically, communicate regularly with your teachers while also collaborating with your peers to
maximize success. Strengthening our school culture requires us to be collectively accountable to the
expectations. The cleanliness and presentation of our campus facility is everyone’s responsibility.
We are thrilled to partner with our students and families. Our ongoing commitment to collaboration is
essential at this vital moment in Franklin’s history. We are here for and with you!
In partnership,
Alex Jarrell, CEO
Dr. Kendall McManus-Thomas, Principal

MISSION & BELIEFS
The mission of Benjamin Franklin High School is to prepare students of high academic
achievement to be successful in life.
Our Beliefs:
● Academic growth is the highest priority within a school environment rich in
extracurricular opportunities.
● Instruction in reading, writing, speaking, and research skills is the shared responsibility of
all teachers in all disciplines.
● All students need to become lifelong learners, and for most graduates, the next logical
step in that process is to attend a college, university, or military academy.
● All students need to be given opportunities to learn through cooperation as well as
competition.
● Individual and cultural diversity is a value to be understood, affirmed, and nurtured.
● Giving students the opportunity to communicate in other languages increases their ability
to view the world as a global village, improve their communication skills, and gain a
genuine understanding of another culture.
● A sound education includes experiences in the creative and/or performing arts.
● Physical, emotional, and mental wellness are essential.
● All students need to develop a sense of community and social responsibility. Good
citizenship requires awareness of the rights and needs of others.
“Benjamin Franklin High School challenges students demonstrating the greatest academic aptitude to achieve personal academic
excellence.” What is academic aptitude? Academic aptitude is the ability to achieve academic excellence. What is academic
excellence? Academic excellence is the demonstrated ability to perform, achieve, and excel in scholastic and creative activities. But
academic excellence is more than just high test scores and good grades. It is the maximum development of each student's intellectual
and creative capacities and skills in service to humanity.’
Wayne Collier, Class of 1969 and President of the Benjamin Franklin Alumni Association.

ACADEMIC LIFE
Student BFHS Email Accounts
Students are expected to check their email daily to stay informed about important announcements, academic updates, and engage in meaningful
communication with faculty and peers. Students should promptly respond to emails.
Attendance
In order to prepare students for high academic achievement, we need students to be present and on time for class.
School Hours
The school day is from 8:05 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. Security is on campus from 7:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. Students arriving before 7:55 a.m. will sit in the
courtyard and cafeteria which will be open and supervised beginning at 7:00 a.m. daily. Classrooms will be open at 7:55 a.m. All students may
report to their first period class at 7:55 a.m. Any student not seated at 8:05 a.m. will be considered tardy.
Tardiness Procedures
The only tardies that can be excused are those due to medical reasons or court appointments, in which case, documentation must be provided
upon returning to school.
If students report to school after 8:05 a.m., they must report to the front office to sign in and get a tardy pass.
If students report to class late, their teachers will record tardiness in PowerSchool.
Students at UNO will report directly to class.
Tardiness:
1. Students will not be tardy to any class including study hall. Teachers will record all class tardiness in PowerSchool.
2. Classroom teachers may handle tardiness to classes (e.g. student conversation, parent conference, teacher detentions).
3. Once a student has been tardy five or more times to class, students will be assigned an administrative detention.
Additional actions may include administrative detentions, conference with student’s Mental Health Professional, mandatory parent
conference, coding the student truant in PowerSchool, or In-School Suspensions. Note: In-school suspensions must be reported as part of
most college applications processes.
Attendance Requirements
BESE regulations state “In order to be eligible to receive Carnegie credit for a course, students must be present 94% of the required time.”
Therefore, a student who misses a class five or more times in one semester has missed more than the allowable time and will be required to
make up missed instructional time through seat time recovery. Students can use seat time recovery to make up a maximum of five class
periods per class during one semester.
The maximum number of student absences per class per semester is ten. After ten student absences in one class
during one semester, course credit will be lost, and students will have to retake the course.
In order to participate in after school extracurricular activities, including athletics, a student must be physically present in school for 75% on
the day of the activity. Students must be physically present on Friday for 75% of the day in order to participate in athletic and club activities
over the weekend.
Homebound instruction shall be provided on the eleventh school day following an absence of more than 10 consecutive school days for a
qualifying illness.

[Page 8]
Types of Absences (According to LA Bulletin 741)
I. Excused absences are absences of two or fewer consecutive school days incurred due to personal illness or serious illness in the
family. After five excused or unexcused absences per class per semester, students will need to recover seat time. Seat time recovery
must be completed outside of normal class time on school grounds.
● House Bill 353 / Act 318 provides students with three excused absence days for mental or behavioral health with
parent/guardian communication. Students do not need a medical excuse.
● Students who engage in formal visits to colleges/universities will be excused from two school days each school year if
they provide formal documentation of the visit from the college/university. These days will be excused but not exempt, and
students will need to make up missed work. Students will communicate with their teachers prior to any planned absences.
○ Both mental health and college visit excused absences will count towards students’ total excused absences and
will trigger seat time if students exceed five excused or unexcused absences per class per semester.
II. Exempted absences are absences that allow a student to make up missed work but do not require that time be made up. They include:
● extended personal physical or emotional illness in which a student is absent for three or more consecutive school days as verified
by a physician or nurse practitioner licensed in the state;
● extended hospital stay in which a student is absent for three or more consecutive school days as verified by a physician or dentist;
● death in the family (not to exceed five school days);
● extended recuperation from an accident in which a student is absent for three or more consecutive school days as verified by a
physician, dentist, or nurse practitioner licensed in the state;
● extended contagious disease within a family in which a student is absent for three or more consecutive school days as verified by a
physician or dentist licensed in the state;
● observance of special and recognized holidays of the student’s own faith, which must be applied for at least seven days in advance;
● visitation with a parent who is a member of the United States Armed Forces or the National Guard of a state and such parent has
been called to duty for or is on leave from overseas deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting (not exceeding five
school days), which must be applied for at least seven days in advance;
● school approved travel for education, which must be applied for at least seven days in advance.
Note: Only administration can specify that these absences need not be counted. They are not automatically discounted.
The only other exceptions to the attendance policy shall be absences that are verified and approved in advance of the absence by the Principal
or their designee. For any other extenuating circumstances, the student’s parents or legal guardian must make a formal appeal in accordance
with the due process procedures at least seven days in advance.
Students who are verified as meeting extenuating circumstances are still responsible for completing coursework in order to pass the class.
III. Unexcused absences count toward the total number of semester absences. Students will receive a 25% deduction from the
grade-earned on late assignments due to unexcused absences. Some examples include truancy, suspension, absenteeism for
social/personal reasons (e.g. family vacations, international travel, family weddings, senior skip day, sports tournaments not affiliated
with the school, etc.) Any student absent for a semester final exam without providing medical documentation will receive a 10%
deduction on their exam grade.
Students shall not be excused from school to work on any job, even in their own homes or for their own parents.

[Page 9]
Student Communication Expectations Regarding Absences
When students are absent, they are expected to check Google Classroom for any missed assignments or announcements. Students must also
check their school email regularly and respond promptly to any communication from teachers regarding makeup work or assessments. It is the
student’s responsibility to reach out to teachers to clarify expectations, request materials, and schedule any necessary make-up work. Being
proactive and engaged during an absence ensures a smooth transition back into the classroom.
Absence Reporting Procedures
For Both Excused and Unexcused Absences:
1-5 class periods during one
semester
6-10 class periods during one
semester
More than 10 class periods during
one semester
Seat Time and
Course Credit
Consequences
Students will need to
complete seat time to
recover these absences.
Students will not earn
credit for the course.
School
Documentation
When students are absent, their parent/guardian will notify the main office by email (attendance@bfhsla.org)
before 8:30 AM the day of the absence. The email will include the student’s name, the date, and the reason for the
absence. Without parent contact, the absence will remain UNVERIFIED, and parents will receive an automated
message notifying them of the student absence.
If an absence note is not submitted to attendance@bfhsla.org by the following Wednesday at 8 AM, the absence
will become an unexcused absence.
Communication with
Teacher/Make-Up
Work
Students will communicate with their teachers.
When students are absent for a summative assessment, they have, at minimum, an equal number of
days they were absent to complete the assessment when they return. The school advises students to
make up all summative assessments within five school days of returning to campus.
Students with extended absences will work with their counselor to develop a makeup plan to complete work in
the order it was missed.
For any unexcused absence, a 25% deduction will be imposed on missed summative assessments.
Students who miss a semester final exam and do not provide medical documentation will have 10% deducted
from their exam grade.
Note: The school will excuse late arrival or tardiness with a medical professional’s note on the day of the lateness, presented upon the student’s
arrival at school. When there is a city-wide disruption of traffic flow, the school will excuse tardiness at administrative discretion.
Early Check Out
If a parent/guardian needs an early check out for their child, the parent/guardian can either come to the school prior to 2:45 p.m. or email
attendance@bfhsla.org. The email will include the student’s name, the date, and the reason for the early check out. All students will need to
check out through the front office. Any student who fails to check out through the front office will be subject to truancy policy. Students who
check out early are subject to the school’s absence policy.
If a student is leaving school early without a parent/guardian picking them up, a parent/guardian must email attendance@bfhsla.org one hour
prior to the check out time and include the student’s name, the date, and the reason for the early check out.
Students may not be checked out after 2:45 PM on a normal school day. Students will not be checked out by phone calls to
the school during the school day.

[Page 10]
Communication from the School Regarding Absences
❖ Unexcused absences: The school will email parent/guardian after three unexcused absences in any course in one semester.
❖ Excused absences: If a student reaches five excused absences, the school will email parent/guardian at the progress report mark
(every 4.5 weeks) to alert families and provide next steps for seat-time recovery.
❖ Biweekly reports: DeansList will automatically send out biweekly reports to families that include snapshots on grades, tardies, and
absences.
Seat Time Recovery from Excessive Absences
If a student has five or more total excused or unexcused absences per credit bearing class, they must complete seat time recovery before the end
of the semester to earn credit for that class.
- Students can use seat time recovery to make up a maximum of five class periods per class during one semester.
- The maximum number of student absences per class per semester is ten. After ten student absences in one class during one semester,
course credit will be lost and students will have to retake the course.
- If students do not complete seat time recovery before the end of the semester, they will receive an Incomplete in the course.
Seat Time Recovery (STR) can be done only outside normal school hours, before 8:05 a.m. or after 3:30 p.m. Students will be able to complete
STR during exam week when they do not have a scheduled exam.
Read more about Seat Time Recovery here.
Truancy Law
Louisiana Truancy Law (Excerpt)
R.S. 17:233 ACT 745
Cases of habitual absence and/or tardiness referred to juvenile or family court:
A. Any student who is a juvenile and who is habitually absent from school or is habitually tardy shall be reported by visiting
teachers and supervisors of child welfare and attendance to the family or juvenile court of the parish or city as a truant child,
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title VII of the Louisiana Children’s Code relative to families in need of services,
there to be dealt with in such manner as the court may determine either by placing the truant in a home or in a public or
private institution where school may be provided for the child, or otherwise, B. (1) (a) A student shall be considered
habitually absent or habitually tardy when either condition continues to exist after all reasonable efforts by any school
personnel, truancy officer, or other law enforcement personnel have failed to correct the condition after the fifth unexcused
absence or fifth unexcused occurrence of being tardy within any school semester. (b) The parent or legal guardian of a
student shall enforce the attendance of the student at the school to which the student is assigned. (c) The principal of the
school, or his designee, shall notify the parent or legal guardian in writing upon a student’s third unexcused absence or
unexcused occurrence of being tardy, and shall hold a conference with such student’s parent or legal guardian. The
student’s parent or legal guardian shall sign a receipt for such notification.
Please note: the school is required to place a “truancy flag” on the record of any student who has five (5) unexcused
absences or tardies in one semester. This flag becomes part of the student’s enrollment record. This information is uploaded
to the state on a regular basis.

[Page 11]
Passes To and From Classes
We expect all students to be present and on time to every class and study hall every day. If a student must leave a class for a brief
period of time, the student must sign out and leave with a hall pass. Only one student at a time may leave a class.
Students who are in the hall without a pass will be issued Friday detentions.
To see a Teacher, Counselor, or Mental Health Professional during study hall:
1. Students will request a signed pass, email confirmation, or calendar invite from the faculty/staff member they
wish to visit.
2. Students will show the pass,email, or calendar event to their study hall teacher at the beginning of the period and
then proceed to their destination.
3. Students will return the signed pass to their study hall teacher before the end of that period.
To attend a College Representative Visit:
1. Students will pick up a blank college rep pass from the counseling suite at least three days before the visit.
2. Students will get the college visit pass signed by the appropriate teacher and submit their RSVP in Naviance.
3. Students will bring the completed pass to the college visit and turn it into the counselors.
Teachers may not send students to any location in the school without a written request from the supervising teacher of
that area. This includes the courtyard, gym, computer labs, cafeteria, counseling suite, and auditorium.
Certificate of Attendance Forms (required by the DMV)
The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and Driving School will only accept a physically signed form. It is time sensitive and will not be
accepted after three (3) weeks past the date on the signed form. To request a form, please email forms@bfhsla.org. Office staff will notify you
when your form is available to pick up.
Work Permits
Work Permits are issued by school staff. For more information or to request an Employment Certificate, please email forms@bfhsla.org. Office
staff will contact you to arrange a time to issue the permit.
Maintaining Current Student Contact Information
The smooth operation of the school helps to maintain a healthy, safe, and productive learning environment for our students and staff. To
maintain this environment, each student/parent must help us keep our contact information records up to date.
1. We need a parent/guardian phone number, as well as a current mailing address. When there is a change in any of these, please send
that change to the Registrar, Eboni Anderson (eanderson@bfhsla.org). A proof of the new mailing address needs to be included when
requesting an address change.
2. Without prior arrangements we will only release students to legal guardians and to those persons listed on the emergency form.
Keep this information current. This is for your child’s safety.

[Page 12]
Academic Integrity
The school community dedicates itself to promoting a learning environment
based on the foundations of personal integrity and expects its students to
practice honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility.
Principles that Govern Academic Integrity
All forms of academic dishonesty are strictly forbidden, constitute
a major offense, and will result in disciplinary action. Attempted
academic dishonesty, even if unsuccessful, will be treated as
academic dishonesty.
Transgressions involving academic dishonesty include, but are not
limited to:
➢ using AI software to complete an assignment without permission.
➢ copying from others or allowing another student to copy.
➢ accessing questions online and/or copying answers from an online source.
➢ providing or receiving information about all or part of an exam, including answers (e.g., telling someone in a subsequent period what
was on your exam or being told this information).
➢ having or using notes, formulas, or other information that is not specifically authorized by the teacher (e.g. accessing “cheat sheets”
with answers, information programmed in a calculator, websites during an online assessment, Google translate or other translation
applications, notes, etc.).
➢ having or using an electronic device to send or obtain information. Simply having possession of any prohibited or unauthorized
device, whether or not it is actually used, is an act of academic dishonesty.
➢ taking an exam for another student or permitting someone else to take a test for you.
➢ altering a graded exam and resubmitting it for a better grade.
➢ gaining or providing unauthorized access to examination materials.
➢ talking to another student during an assessment. Simply talking to another student, even if no assessment content is discussed, is
an act of academic dishonesty.
➢ including any materials not based on your own research and/or writing in a submitted assignment.
This includes, but is not limited to:
■ Using the services of a website.
■ Using the services of another student.
■ Copying part or all of another person’s paper and submitting it as your own.
➢ acting as a provider of paper(s) for another student(s).
➢ submitting substantial portions of the same academic work for credit in more than one course without consulting both teachers
(self-plagiarism).
➢ failing to use quotation marks or citations where appropriate.
➢ failing to properly acknowledge paraphrased materials via textual attribution, footnotes, endnotes and/or a bibliography.
➢ making up data for an experiment.
➢ citing nonexistent sources (articles, books, etc.).
➢ misrepresenting the academic accomplishments and/or records of yourself or someone else, such as by tampering with
computer records.
➢ deceiving a teacher or making up a false reason or excuse to get special consideration on an exam or an extension for an exam
or paper.
➢ forging a signature.
➢ helping another student engage in academic dishonesty.
➢ gaining unfair/unauthorized advantage over fellow students in an academic exercise.
Following the integrity policies that govern ACT, SAT, and AP testing, if there is reasonable suspicion that a student had an unfair
advantage and failed to complete an assignment with full personal integrity, we will discard the original assignment and ask the student
to complete a retake.

[Page 13]
A retake could look like:
- A student providing a verbal explanation of the content in a one-on-one interview with the teacher
- A student completing a shortened version of the assignment
- A student completing a full retake of the assignment
- A student completing an alternative assignment based on the same content/skills
- A student completing the assignment without an opportunity to use the aid of technology (e.g. handwriting instead of typing)
or in a locked mode on a school device
Additionally, students may be asked to defend or verify their work by presenting notes, drafts, works cited, etc.
Academic Integrity Process and Consequences
1. Teacher conferences with the student and notifies the student's family.
2. Teacher documents the incident using a required form, which is sent to the Dean of Student Life.
3. Teacher, working in conjunction with the Dean of Student Life, decides on an appropriate course of action regarding the assignment.
a. For a formative assessment, students will receive a zero.
b. For a summative assessment first offense, students must have the opportunity to redo the assessment to earn up to 50%
credit. For any additional offenses while at Franklin, students will receive a zero.
c. In research-intensive courses, if a student commits plagiarism on the academic research paper, the student must earn a
passing grade on the revised paper to earn a 50%.
4. The Dean of Student Life notifies the student’s family and meets with the student to discuss the incident, restorative practices, and any
consequences.
a. First offense: One-hour after school detention
b. Second offense (considered per tenure at the school, not per teacher or per year): One-day in-school suspension
i. In-school suspensions must be reported for most college applications.
c. Additional offenses: Consequences will escalate accordingly following a second offense.
5. The Dean of Student Life records the incident in PowerSchool and notifies the teacher and student’s counselor.
6. Students can appeal the decision to the Principal if they feel they were unjustly accused. The Principal will review the evidence and
determine the consequences, which can be more or less severe than the original teacher's determination.
Progress Reports / Report Card
We designed our system of report cards, progress reports, e-mails, and phone calls to keep all parents informed regularly about the standing their
child has in each of his/her classes.
Interim Progress Reports Interim progress reports will be emailed and a printed copy will be sent home approximately every 4-5 weeks.
Teachers may also choose to send home individual student progress reports at any time during the year.
Report cards will be issued at the end of each semester. For each course, these list the semester final exam grade and the final grade for the
semester. Final grades and credits are recorded in the student’s transcript at the end of each semester.
Honor Roll designations are awarded to students whose unweighted semester GPA is 3.85 or higher and who have no grades less than a “B” on
their report card.
Principal's Honor Roll designations are awarded to students whose unweighted semester GPA is 4.00 or higher and who have no grades
less than an "A" on their report card.
Biweekly Reports/PowerSchool Up to date information is always available via PowerSchool. Additionally, the school will email biweekly
reports via the DeansList platform that includes a snapshot of current grades, attendance, tardies, shoutouts, and disciplinary issues.

Grading Scale
Student Support
Getting Academic Support
We want everyone to succeed to their maximum ability. The first step in achieving success is
being willing to seek help. Here’s how students can do so:
● A student’s classroom teacher is their first source of help. Faculty members
have regularly scheduled times before school, during lunch, and/or after school to
offer help. Students should find out when teachers are available via this spreadsheet
and reach out to them.
● Our Academic Counselors are ready to talk with students about study skills, time
management, academic concerns, and college prep.
● Our Mental Health Professionals are ready to help students learn good mental health practices that will help improve their
approach to academic work and establish healthy relationships.
In addition, we ask teachers to inform the counselors when a student is struggling. When there is evidence of a need for intervention, the
Student Assistance Team (SAT) meets about a specific student. The parent/guardian(s), the student, and the teachers involved are invited to
discuss formally what might be the best options to get help for the student. Teachers use phone calls and e-mails to inform parents/guardians
whenever they feel the need to discuss a specific problem or to pass on praise.
The Louisiana Department of Education provides free online tutoring and assistance at Homework Louisiana. The school also partners with
Varsity Tutors and PeerKonnect to provide 24/7 online academic support to students.
Policy on Homework, Projects, and Assessments
1. All homework assignments must be incorporated into a class discussion or learning objective, or graded and returned within two weeks
of the due date. If graded homework is not returned within two weeks, and the homework was turned in on time, the grade will
automatically become 100%.
2. No assignment—reading, homework, assessment, project, etc.—may be added or increased between class meetings. Teachers may
reduce an assignment between class periods.
3. Summative assessments must be posted on Google Classroom at least one week prior to their due date.
4. There can be no tests, quizzes, presentations, or projects scheduled on the two days before the first semester final exam without the
permission of the Assistant Principal of Academics.
5. Usual one night homework can be assigned during holiday breaks. Breaks cannot be used to assign extra reading or worksheets in order
to “get caught up” or a new project or presentation.
6. A student (or parent) who expresses an initial concern to someone other than the teacher about a grade, assignment, or another issue in
the class shall, with any helpful coaching, be directed to speak first with the teacher.

7. Quizzes and collected homework will be reviewed or returned in class at least one class period before the summative assessment. If not
returned or reviewed, the material is not permitted to be on the summative assessment.
8. Teachers will be required to communicate homework assignments by 4:30 PM the day the class meets on Google Classroom.
Workload Policy
1. Students may continue to select and schedule courses that best meet their academic goals. However, the Assistant Principal of
Academics and parents/guardians must give approval for a freshman or sophomore scheduling more than two AP courses; for a junior
scheduling more than four AP courses; and for a senior scheduling more than five AP courses. Information will be provided to these
parents indicating the work necessary for successful completion of the AP courses.
2. Students may not hold the office of president in more than one club or organization at the same time. (In addition to managing
workload, this can create opportunities for leadership for more students.)
3. Students will not be allowed to take 8 credit-bearing classes without written permission from the Assistant Principal of Academics.
Deferring Assessments Policy
In an effort to reduce student stress, there is a system to allow a student to defer an assessment if that student has been assigned three or more
in-class summative assessments that take place during the regularly scheduled class time on the same day. If a student sits for a College Board
Advance Placement exam in May, the AP exam will count as two tests for this deferral policy.
Steps for the student to take to request a deferral:
1. The student will complete the Deferral Request no later than 8:00 a.m. the school day before the
assessments. This form is also available on students’ class Google Classroom under Test Deferment.
2. The student will indicate which of their three assessments they intend to defer.
- Students may not defer an assessment in the same subject more than one time per semester.
3. If a student has four in-class summative assessments in one day they may defer two of them. In
this case, please email the Testing Coordinator directly instead of filling out the form.
On submission, the Testing Coordinator will immediately begin the approval process by confirming
the nature of the assignment with each of the teachers the student indicated on the form. Once
approved, the student will receive an email from the Testing Coordinator which will serve as their deferral pass. The course teacher of the
deferred assessment will be cc’d on the email.
It is the responsibility of the student to work with their course teacher to agree upon a date when they will be taking their deferred assessment.
The time and date must be suitable for both parties. Neither a deferred makeup assessment nor a retake will be considered a third assessment.
Feedback or suggestions about our deferment policy are welcome. Please email the Testing Coordinator with any questions or concerns.

[Page 16]
Dropping a Course
Requests for particular teachers will not be accepted or entertained unless the student has had the teacher in a previous graded class. There will
be limited opportunity to change courses due to restrictions on maximum class size.
- 11th and 12th graders may not request a change of levels within a course. For example, a student in English IV AP cannot request a
change to English IV Gifted. Changing electives may be possible if space permits.
- 9th and 10th graders can request elective changes and level changes (AP, gifted, honors). Parent consent must be provided before
counselors consider any requests.
Semester 1 Deadline to add a course for credit Friday, August 22, 2025
Deadline to drop a course Friday, September 19, 2025
Semester 2 Deadline to add a new S2 course for credit Friday, January 16, 2026
Deadline to drop a new S2 course Wednesday, February 11, 2026
Grading
In the modified block schedule, Teachers are expected to enter a minimum of 2 formative grades every two weeks and a minimum one summative
assessment per marking period (every 4.5 weeks).
Gradebook Categories:
Formative: 30%
Summative: 45%
Semester Final Exam: 25%
What’s the difference between formative and summative assessments?
If a student is absent for a summative assessment, teachers will leave the grade blank in PowerSchool for five school days. If the student hasn’t
made up the assessment in five school days, teachers will change the grade to a zero until the student completes the assessment. If the absence
is unexcused, the students will receive a 25% deduction on the grade earned when completed.
If a student is absent for a formative assessment, teachers will code the assignment as “Absent” and choose whether they want to leave it blank or
enter a zero until completed. If the absence is unexcused, students will receive a maximum 25% deduction on the grade earned when completed.
For summative assessments, a teacher must provide a pathway for which a student who completed the assessment on time can earn a minimum
of 50% on the assignment utilizing makeups, alternative assignments, corrections or other methods as determined by the teacher. This policy
does not apply to semester final exams.
Any student absent for a semester final exam without providing medical documentation will receive a 10% deduction on
their exam grade.

[Page 17]
Retention Policy
1. All final grades for the core academic subjects taken at the school (English, mathematics, science, social studies, and world language)
will be averaged using unweighted grade point values: (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0).
2. In these academic subjects, all students must earn a 2.0 grade point average (GPA).
3. We compute final retention GPA at the end of the school year (this is an average of 1st and 2nd semester core classes). Students
who are below the 2.0 retention GPA at the end of the year cannot remain at Franklin.
4. We will notify all students who are at or below the retention average at 4.5 week intervals throughout the school year.
Example 1:
Subject Grade Final retention
grade points
English B = 3
World Geo D = 1
Algebra I C = 2
Physics C = 2
Spanish I C = 2
Health and PE B*
Total: 5 classes 10 pts.
GradePoint Average = 10 pts.÷5 core classes =2.0 Retention GPA
This student is AT OR ABOVE the retention average.
Example 2:
Subject Grade Final retention
grade points
English B = 3
World Geo D = 1
Algebra I C = 2
Physics D = 1
Spanish I C = 2
Health and PE A*
Total: 5 classes 9 pts.
GradePoint Average = 9 pts.÷5 core classes =1.8 Retention GPA
This student is BELOW the retention average.
Example 3: student elects to double up on academic subjects (i.e. two math, two sciences) in a single year, both grades will be used in
retention calculations and therefore divided by 6.
Subject Grade Final retention
grade points
English B = 3
World History D = 1
Algebra II C = 2
Geometry D = 1
Chemistry C = 2
German II C = 2
PE A*
Total: 6 classes 11 pts.
Grade Point Average = 11 pts.÷6 core classes =1.83 Retention GPA
This student is BELOW the retention average.
*These grades are not included in determining the retention average.
Note: Parents should remember that the retention GPA is the same as the average used to determine eligibility for activities. The grade point
average printed on transcripts and report cards is a “weighted” GPA and not the retention/eligibility GPA. To determine the
retention/eligibility GPA you must use a strict 4-point scale and then only for the grades for the five major academic subjects.

COMMUNITY LIFE
Benjamin Franklin High School staff strive to provide an environment conducive to learning. We encourage students to participate in many
facets of our community. We treasure the classroom environment where each student is an important member of that community. Respectful
and courteous behavior toward teachers, staff, and fellow students create an environment where students are encouraged to share their ideas
as well as learn from each other. We believe in teaching and affirming positive student behavior. However, we do recognize that there are
behaviors that detract from our environment, and a list of those negative behaviors and the corresponding disciplinary actions are listed below.
This list is not comprehensive but rather a guide to community standards. The administration reserves the right to impose reasonable
expectations of student behavior.
Classroom Behavioral Concern Responses
Teachers and parents/guardians are encouraged to use these steps before escalating a classroom behavioral concern to administration.
1. Student-teacher conference
2. Student-teacher-parent conference
3. Referral to Academic Counselor/Mental Health Professional
4. Referral to Dean of Student Life
Anti-Bullying
We strive to make the school a bully-free zone, as all individuals within our learning
community have a right to attend school in a non-threatening environment where they are
treated with dignity and respect. All students are strongly encouraged to report any and
all instances of suspected bullying to another teacher or anyone in administration.
Benjamin Franklin High School staff will cooperate/collaborate with district and/or civil
officials in any documentation, reporting, disciplinary action, etc. associated with an
alleged misconduct.
Louisiana Law (La. R. S. 17:416.13) defines bullying as a pattern of one or more of the
following:
● Gestures, including but not limited to obscene gestures and making faces;
● Written, electronic, or verbal communication, including but not limited to calling names, threatening to harm, taunting, malicious
teasing, or spreading untrue rumors.
● Electronic (cyber) communication includes but is not limited to a communication or image transmitted or image transmitted by email,
instant message, text message, blog, or social networking website through the use of a telephone, mobile phone, computer, or other
electronic device.
● Physical acts, including but not limited to hitting, kicking, pushing, tripping, choking, damaging personal property, or unauthorized use
of personal property; and or
● Repeatedly and purposefully shunning or excluding from activities
Cyberbullying
Cyberbullying is the use of any electronic communication device to convey a message in any form (text, image, audio, or video) that defames,
intimidates, harasses or is otherwise intended to harm, insult or humiliate another in a deliberate, repeated or hostile and unwanted manner under
a person’s true or false identity. The school will not tolerate cyberbullying and will address it in accordance with disciplinary policies.
Anti-Discrimination
Benjamin Franklin High School does not discriminate in any programs or activities on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion, color, national origin,
age, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal.
Any student who believes that discrimination has occurred should report the incident to the school’s Title IX Coordinator.

[Page 20]
At the school there are five levels of detention/suspension for Class I behaviors. Detentions/suspensions escalate with the
severity and the repetition of unacceptable behavior.
1. Teacher Detention: Teachers may assign this to students for a variety of Class I behaviors or may refer the student to the
administration. This type of detention may last up to one hour before or two hours after school and requires parent notification at least
the day before. Teachers may also assign detentions during the lunch period. If a student skips a teacher detention, the teacher will
refer the student to the Dean of Student Life for an administrative detention.
2. Administrative Detention: The administration assigns this for a variety of Class I behaviors. They last for one hour and require at
least one day’s prior notice to parents/guardians.
3. Extended Detention: The administration assigns this for elevated or repeated Class I behaviors. They last for two or more hours
and require prior notice to parents/guardians.
4. In-School Suspension: The Dean of Student Life assigns this for a variety of Major Infractions (Class II behaviors) or repeated
Minor Infractions(Class I violations) as determined by the administration.
5. Out-of-School Suspension: The Dean of Student Life assigns this for a variety of more serious behaviors. See the Major
Infractions (Class II behaviors) listed below. Students who have been suspended (in school or out of school) three times within a
year will be recommended for expulsion for their next suspendable behavior.
6. The School reserves the right to use Restorative Practices when applicable.
The parent is responsible for providing transportation to and from school for students in detention.
Note: In-school suspensions are reported on most college and university applications
Electronic Device Policy
According to Louisiana's State Law Section 1. R.S. 17:239(A), students may NOT use any unauthorized
electronic device such as cell phones, smart watches, headphones, earphones (buds), during the
instructional school day that begins 8:05 am - 3:30 pm. Electronic devices must be powered off
completely and may not be on a student’s person (in pockets, jacket, waistband, etc.)
Electronic devices may NOT be used for any reason during class, the passing of classes, school assemblies,
and other school events during the school day. They may NOT be used in classrooms or study halls or in any
common areas, including courtyards or fields, or bathrooms during the instructional school day.
For now, administration will allow students to use their devices during the lunch period only. Students have the responsibility to be able to
transition back to no electronic devices as soon as lunch ends. Additionally, students may use wired headphones for educational purposes when
approved by their teacher.
If an electronic device is seen or heard, the electronic device will be taken to the Dean of Student Life’s Office and the following actions
will occur:
1. 1st Instance: The electronic device may be recovered by the student from the Dean of Student Life and a 2-hour Friday
detention will be assigned.
2. 2nd Instance: The electronic device will be returned only to a parent/guardian by the Dean of Student Life and a 3-hour Saturday
detention will be assigned.
3. 3rd Instance: The electronic device will be returned only to a parent/guardian by the Dean of Student Life and a 4-hour Saturday
detention will be assigned. For the remainder of the school year, the student must check the electronic device in with the Dean of
Student Life before 1st period and may retrieve it after school. If the student does not follow this procedure, an In-School Suspension
will be assigned. The school administration could choose to assign additional consequences, including Out-of-School Suspension, if
further instances occur.
Franklin shall not assume any responsibility for theft, loss, or damage of unauthorized or confiscated electronic devices.

[Page 21]
Consequences for Tardiness
Once a student has been tardy five or more times collectively to any class (including study halls), the student will be assigned an administrative
detention. For every five additional incidences of tardiness to any class, the student will receive an escalated consequence as outlined below:
5 tardies (to any class) 1-hour after school detention
10 tardies (to any class) 2-hour after school detention
15 tardies (to any class) 3-hour Saturday detention
20 tardies (to any class) 4-hour Saturday detention
Loss or Damage to School Property
Students are expected to respect our campus facility and treat all school property with care, including but not limited to: classroom and lab
equipment, furniture, lockers, technology, doors/windows, textbooks, club property, and restroom fixtures. If any school property is damaged,
defaced, or lost due to misuse, neglect, or vandalism, the student/family may be liable for the cost of any repair, replacement, or cleaning.
Excessive circumstances may result in more severe consequences.
Class II and III Behaviors
Major infractions are known as Class II and Class III violations. These violations can have a consequence of suspension to expulsion. The school
reserves the right to use restorative practices to assist with remediating issues caused by major infractions. There is a discipline board
composed of staff and teachers that will meet to address those issues where a recommendation is warranted by the administration.
Although certain consequences are recommended and not mandatory, certain others (Class III behaviors, physical fighting between students, and
strong verbal abuse between students, etc.) will result in an immediate suspension or principal’s recommendation to expel. There is no place here
for such confrontations. We intend to keep the school as a place of scholarship so that all of our students may benefit to the maximum degree.
Example Class I Behaviors Disciplinary Consequence
Leaving Class without a Pass Detention
Sharing a Bathroom Stall Detention
Tobacco Use on Campus (Cigarette/Vaping) Parent conference and Saturday detention
Food Delivery to Campus Detention
Leaving School without Permission Parent conference and Saturday detention
Cutting Class including Study Hall (first offense) Parent conference and 2-hour detention
Dress Code Violation Student conference
Example Class II and III Behaviors Disciplinary Consequence
Fighting 1 to 3 Days ISS OR OSS with Restorative Practices.
Possession of Drugs & Alcohol 2 Day OSS, Mandatory counseling Sessions, Entrance and completion of drug counseling
program, Mandatory signed student and parental contract giving the school permission

[Page 22]
for random searches of student’s book bags and lockers and drug testing for one calendar
year from the date of infraction.
Creating a major disturbance on campus
(w/ physical altercation i.e. pushing/shoving)
2 Day ISS, recommendation to Mental Health Professional and Counselor for mandatory
conflict resolution sessions
Arriving to School or to a School Function
Intoxicated
4 Hour Sat., Online alcohol abuse course, Written essay, Recommendation to Counselor
and Mental Health Professional for mandatory sessions related to alcohol abuse/drug
abuse
Sexual Harassment (unwanted touching of any
student w/ sexual advances)
2 Day OSS, Recommendation to Mental Health Professional and Counselor for mandatory
sessions, essay
In accordance with Louisiana Revised Statute 17:416C, any student after being suspended on three occasions for committing any
suspendable offense during the same school session, shall on committing the fourth offense be expelled from the public
schools of the Parish wherein he/she resides until the beginning of the next regular session, subject to the review of the local
school board. A suspension, whether it is out of school or in-school is a suspension. Suspension differs from detention in that we complete
suspension forms which become a part of the student’s record. Many selective colleges and universities ask the student to answer such a
question as, “Have you ever been suspended, expelled, or denied school attendance in any way?” on their applications.
Note: Students will have an opportunity for make-up work during suspensions. However, that make-up work will have a 25%
deduction from the grade received for that assignment.
A Student Who Commits Multiple Instances of Class II & III Behaviors will result in the school recommending that student to the
OPSB Student Hearing Office for an expulsion which results in a removal from the school.
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT – In no case shall corporal punishment be used.
A student while under in-school suspension, out-of-school suspension or expulsion shall not enjoy the right of participating in any school activity.
A student who is suspended is considered absent, (non-truant) and is allowed to make up his work, and will receive no more than a 25% penalty
reduction in grading and is eligible for consideration for credit provided it is completed satisfactorily and in a timely manner. Students suspended
three or more consecutive days shall be provided schoolwork during their suspension, which must be picked up by the parent/guardian at the
school. A student who is suspended less than 3 consecutive days will receive the assignments after returning from their suspension. A longer
listing of Class II & III violations along with its OPSB suggested Disciplinary Actions are listed here . NOPS Manual for Disciplinary Procedures.
Student Dress and Grooming Code
The primary responsibility for a student’s attire is with the student and parents or guardians. The school is responsible for seeing that student
attire does not interfere with the health or safety of any student and that it does not contribute to a hostile or intimidating atmosphere for any
student. We value all students being able to dress comfortably for school and to engage in the educational environment without fear of or
actual unnecessary discipline or body-shaming. We believe all students and staff should understand that they are responsible for managing
their own personal “distractions” without regulating individual students’ clothing/self-expression. We value teachers being able to focus on
teaching without the additional and often uncomfortable burden of dress code enforcement. We strive to minimize subjectivity by using the
basic principle that certain body parts must be covered for all students at all times.
The goals of this dress code include:
● Maintaining a safe learning environment, including classes where protective or supportive clothing or footwear is needed.
● Allowing students to wear clothing that is comfortable and self-expressive.
● Preventing students from wearing clothing with offensive images or language, including profanity, hate speech, and pornography.
● Preventing students from wearing clothing with images or language depicting or advocating violence or the use of alcohol or drugs.
● Ensuring that all students are treated equitably regardless of gender/gender identification, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, body
type/size, religion, and personal style.

[Page 23]
Students Must Wear:
● A top made of opaque material.
● A bottom that includes pants/sweatpants, shorts, skirts, dress, or leggings made of opaque material.
● Shoes with a back. Closed-toed shoes or other footwear may be required for a particular class or activity.
Students May Wear:
● Hats and hoodie sweatshirts. Both must allow the face and ears to be visible and not interfere with the line of sight of any student or
staff.
● Religious headwear.
● Ripped jeans, as long as underwear is not exposed.
Students Cannot Wear:
● Clothing with images or language that depict violence, drug or alcohol use, hate speech, profanity, pornography, or that create a
hostile or intimidating environment for any segment of the student body.
● Visible underwear.
● Pajamas or bathing suits.
● Flip flops.
● Sunglasses, except for documented medical needs.
● Headwear that obscures the face, except as a religious observance.
Sample Dress Code Infractions
● Not wearing pants, shorts, skirts with opaque material that covers the genitals or buttocks.
● Not wearing a top with opaque material (with fabric on the front, back and the sides under the arms).
● Backless shoes.
● Visible underwear (not including bra straps).
● Pajamas.
● Headwear that obscures the face, except as a religious observance.
Students should be mindful of standards that are often referred to as “professional dress.” Teachers may encourage or require professional
dress for a presentation. Students asked to participate as a school representative will be required to follow this standard. Typically, professional
dress requires a collared shirt or blouse, pants, slacks, or non-ripped jeans, and standard dress or athletic shoes. However, it is best to ask the
teacher or school administrator about the dress requirement prior to your presentation or participation.
The dress code applies all year long when students are at school or school events. This includes evenings/nights, weekends, and the summer.
Dress Code Violations
When a teacher or staff member observes a student who is not following policy, the staff member
will complete a referral in DeansList selecting “1 - Dress Code Violation.” The school administrators
will follow a process, beginning with setting up a student meeting and notifying them of the dress
code infraction. A student will not be removed from the classroom or lose instructional time. If the
dress code violation is causing a disruption, an administrator will be called into the classroom or
area of the school. The first meeting with a student will be a discussion with a warning not to repeat
the violation. If there is a second violation, a student will be assigned detention. Repeated violations
will be treated as willful disobedience and assigned the appropriate consequence.
School ID Expectations
Because wearing ID cards is a frontline measure for overall campus safety, all students and
employees must wear their card in a visible location - around the neck or clipped to a lapel or shirt
pocket. Students’ IDs must be in place when they enter the side gate or walk through the front
door. Student IDs cannot be altered in any way. Wearing an ID is a dress code requirement.
If a student comes to class without an ID, the teacher must send him/her to the main office for a
replacement. Replacement IDs cost $5. If the student does not have the $5, the money will be
charged to the student’s fee bill.

[Page 24]
Senior Privileges
Seniors must maintain both GPA and attendance eligibility to retain senior privileges. Students who appear on the ineligible list due to GPA will
temporarily lose these privileges until the next grading period, when eligibility is reviewed. Students who are ineligible due to attendance will lose
privileges until all required seat time recovery is completed.
Senior privileges go into effect beginning on Friday, September 19th. All seniors are expected to attend all “Senior Study Halls”
until that date.
1. By September 19th, all seniors will indicate if they want to replace their “Senior Study Hall” with a Late Arrival/Early Release or a
traditional study hall. First period students who select Late Arrival should not come to campus until 9:45AM. Fourth period students
who select Early Release should immediately leave campus at the end of third period. Students who select a traditional study hall will be
placed into a study hall for the remainder of the year where their attendance will be taken.
a. Seniors will need familial permission to utilize their Late Arrival/Early Release.
b. Late Arrivals/Early Releases will appear as blanks in students PowerSchool schedules as students should not be on campus
during those times. If students are on campus during this block they will be permanently moved to a traditional study hall for
the remainder of the year where attendance will be taken.
c. Students who arrive just before second period or who are waiting to leave after third period may only be in the atrium. No
seniors are allowed in the courtyard, landings, gym, cafeteria, or any other space on campus.
d. Seniors who have a second study hall scheduled are required to attend that study hall. Senior privileges only apply to students’
“Senior Study Hall.”
2. All seniors with senior privileges are allowed to walk to any food vendor on UNO’s campus during lunch time.
3. Seniors may be exempted from their second semester final exam if their teacher has established this policy in the course syllabus, and
students have an “A” average five school days prior to the course exam.
Note: Seniors must attend all their homerooms. Senior Privileges are subject to change.
Unauthorized Events - Senior/Freshmen Party; Senior Prank
The school will not tolerate any initiation of underclassmen. This is considered bullying and harassment.
The senior prank is an activity which has no administrative sanction, and that could result in the assignment of violations, such as trespassing.
Furthermore, it is an activity which has no place in building a community of respect. In addition to potential for physical damage and disruption,
the history of senior prank has often resulted in a sense of shock and disrespect among the faculty and underclass students. There is no value in
this activity. The administration will work with seniors who want to create a class-wide opportunity for service; a tradition worthy of the school.
Dating Violence
Benjamin Franklin High School believes in an inclusive, non-discriminatory, bully free environment for all of its students. The U.S. National
Institute of Justice defines Teen Dating Violence as the physical, psychological or sexual abuse; harassment; or stalking of any person ages 12 to
18 in the context of a past or present romantic or a consensual relationship. Students who engage in these behaviors will be subject to an
Expulsion recommendation via the New Orleans Public Schools’ Student Hearing Office. The Student Hearing Office will make a placement
determination after hearing all of the facts and reviewing the evidence of each referred case. If there are any students who believe that a peer
may be a victim of dating violence or harassment those students should report the offense to their counselor or school administrator immediately.

[Page 25]
Student Reporting Form
The Student Reporting Form grew out of meetings between Franklin's administration and Student Council members who shared the need for a
centralized reporting system for students to submit their concerns and to hear feedback on these concerns. In response, Franklin's administration
has created this form to streamline communication and allow for a clearer and more effective feedback loop.
We encourage any student who has a concern to speak with the individual(s) concerned before submitting the form.
FOOD SERVICES
NOLA Public Schools is our food service vendor. You can use the online payment system at www.schoolcafe.com to make payments, monitor
students’ cafeteria accounts, and apply for free or reduced meals. The school district is NOLA Public Schools.
We offer a breakfast and lunch program. Breakfast is served in the cafeteria from 7:30 a.m.
to 7:50 a.m.
Students are prohibited from ordering food for delivery or having food delivered to school.
Meal Prices
Breakfast: Full price-$2.75 / Reduced price-$0.30 / Adult $3.25 / Visitor $3.50
Lunch: Full price-$4.20 / Reduced price-$0.40 / Adult $4.75 / Visitor $5.00
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
The school offers a wide variety of athletic teams and student run, faculty sponsored
clubs. A listing of these clubs and teams can be found on the school website.
Clubs and organizations have long been a source of pride and opportunity for our students.
The school will continue to stress the importance of these groups in order to better meet
our mission of promoting excellence and providing opportunities for students to grow as
contributing individuals in our school. Within this context of commitment to the
development of these organizations, the school follows a set of guidelines with respect to the formation, organization and continued
success of each student organization.
These guidelines include, but are not limited to the following principles:
● All organizations are subject to approval by the Dean of Student Life each year.
● Students or group organizers must arrange for a faculty sponsor who will supervise all meetings and activities, approved by the Dean of
Student Life.
● All organizations must follow the policies outlined in this Student Handbook. This includes the grading/participation policies of the
school.
● These organizations are voluntary. Students may be subject to discipline that includes, but not limited to: dismissal from the team or
suspension from practices and participation.
● All issues of organization and function of the club must first go through the team coaches and/or club sponsors.
● Students assume all costs associated with the club or team. This includes uniforms (if needed), equipment, and transportation.
● These organizations, like other groups, represent the school. Students are expected to conduct themselves accordingly.
● Each organization may define rules for governance. These must be approved by the Dean of Student Life. All school policies supersede
any and all rules made by the clubs/organizations.

[Page 26]
Eligibility Requirements for all Athletic and Extracurricular Activities
Arrangements for course and class fee obligations must be made with the Business Office before a student is allowed to participate in any
athletic or extracurricular activities. This includes balances carried forward from a prior academic year.
We encourage full participation in extracurricular and co-curricular activities for all students.
- The first progress report of a semester eligibility will be determined by having below a 2.0 retention average GPA.
- For subsequent progress reports eligibility, a student must maintain a 2.0 retention average with no grades of ‘F’ in order to
participate fully in extracurricular activities. They must also maintain a satisfactory attendance record with no required seat time
recovery.
- Students whose GPA drops below a 2.0 retention average or who do not maintain a satisfactory attendance record may be allowed
very limited participation but will not be allowed to compete or to participate in a game, production, or other culminating event of
the athletic or extracurricular activity.
- Students may not have more than five unexcused absences during the grading period.
These eligibility regulations apply to athletics; academic competitions; exhibitions of literary, performance or graphic arts; and clubs and special
interest organizations. Also included are participation in field trips and special travel, holding class leadership positions, running for election to
any other post, representing the school in any way or working in support of any co-curricular activity.
These requirements apply to all school-related activities that occur outside class time that are not a part of a grade in a course. For example:
Participation in the winter instrumental concerts is a part of the student’s grade in the course. Therefore, eligibility requirements do not apply.
Note: A student who is not physically present for at least 75% of the school day will not be allowed to participate in any co-curricular or
extracurricular activity that day with the exception of a doctor’s note.
● A student who is not physically present for at least 75% of classes the day before will not be allowed to participate in a weekend
activity with the exception of a doctor’s note.
● A student who is not physically present for at least 75% of the school day before the activity will not be allowed to participate in a
special travel field trip with the exception of a doctor’s note.
Responsibility for Declaring a Student Ineligible
It is the responsibility of the coach/sponsor of any activity to determine that students are eligible for the activity before they are allowed to
participate. If a student loses eligibility during an activity that has already begun, it is the coach/sponsor’s responsibility to communicate the
change in eligibility status to the parent. The retention average eligibility criteria is a minimum. Any sponsor may set a higher academic
eligibility level for any activity or may refuse eligibility to any student for academic or disciplinary reasons.
Additional Requirements for Interscholastic Athletics/ Students must:
1. meet all L.H.S.A.A. eligibility requirements.
2. have on file with the Athletic Director of the school a current physical (per LHSAA regulation). Forms are available in the school office
and on-line at the BFHS website under Athletics. Physicals must be completed before a student is allowed to participate in practices
and games.
3. submit a copy of the birth certificate to the new Katherine Johnson Campus site.
4. furnish the coach with all required LHSAA & LCMC forms signed by a parent or guardian.
5. pay a participation fee determined by the administration at the beginning of each school year.
NOTE: Participation fees are non-refundable and must be paid by a predetermined date for each sport. The payment of these fees does not
insure a student’s participation in practices or games. (See the activities/athletic handbook for details.)
Travel Requiring Payment
For activities involving trips for which students pay money, teachers must follow a process that involves (1) approval of the trip by the principal;
(2) preliminary parent and teacher permission; (3) contract between the parent and the trip sponsor; (4) initial deposit; (5) interim payments;
(6) final payment; and (7) departure. A student must maintain a retention average of at least 2.0 throughout every stage of the process or be

[Page 27]
declared ineligible to go on the trip. Even when the student loses academic eligibility between the final payment and departure, the student may
not travel and must cancel the trip.
Parents and students should read and understand cancellation and refund policies of the company that organizes the trip or tour. Trip sponsors
should make sure to specify that policy before the first deposit is collected. Cancellation usually results in the forfeiture of some or all of the
money and is the responsibility of the family of the student and never the school. Parents are encouraged to consider some sort of trip
cancellation insurance to cover such contingencies. The cost of field trips must be covered by the participating students.
MEDICATION POLICY
Students are not permitted to have in their possession any medication (prescription or non-prescription) while under school
supervision except when ordered by the physician for an urgent need (i.e., asthma inhaler) and after consultation between the
parent or legal guardian and the school nurse. If possible, the parent or legal guardian is advised to give medication to the
student at home and on a schedule other than school hours. If any medication (prescription or non-prescription) must be
administered at school, the following procedures must be followed:
1. The initial supply of medication must be delivered to the school nurse by the parent or guardian.
2. All medication (prescription and non-prescription), MUST be accompanied by a physician’s medication order on the State of
Louisiana Medication Order Form. Please ask your pharmacist to provide separate bottles for school and home use.
3. A Parent/Legal Guardian’s Request and Authorization for Medication in Louisiana Public School Systems Form will be signed by
a parent or legal guardian.
4. The forms and the medication will be reviewed by the school nurse. The student will be assessed by the school nurse.
5. The parent or guardian will provide no more than a 20-school day supply of medication to be kept at school. There is no means to
store medication in refrigerators.
6. The parent or guardian will administer the first dose of medication at home and observe the student for possible side effects.
7. The State of Louisiana Medication Order Form is to be renewed at the beginning of each school year and if the medication, dosage,
route of administration or time of administration is changed during the school year.
8. Medication will be destroyed if not picked up at the end of the school year or when the medication
orders are discontinued.
Parents can obtain and print the medication forms that are available on the BFHS website. Contact
the school nurse for more information at (504) 286-2600.
What do I do when I become ill at school?
● Notify the adult supervising you when you become ill. (Example: teacher, coach)
● If you are not in a classroom, go to the main office to report your illness.
● DO NOT CALL A PARENT/GUARDIAN FROM ANY PHONE OTHER THAN THE PHONES IN
THE MAIN OFFICE OR NURSE’S OFFICE.
What do I do when I have an accident or injury at school?
● Notify the adult supervising you at the time of injury. (Example: coach, teacher, adult on duty during lunch time, etc.)
● The adult will notify the main office, complete an Injury Report and send it to the main office. The Injury Report forms are
available online and in the Main Office.
● The school nurse will do an assessment and follow up of the injury.

PARKING, PICKUP & DROP OFF
Dropping Off and Picking Up Students:
Due to the high volume of traffic, the drop-off and pick-up times for our students can often create unforeseen hazards. It is imperative, for
the safety of our students, that extra caution be used and only the following locations be utilized:
a) The parking lot in front of the school. There are two lanes for this purpose. The driver must remain with the vehicle.
b) Inside the Faculty Parking lot on St. Anthony Street by Falcon Field. See image below. Parents will use the 2nd
entrance to the parking lot. Once parents enter the parking lot, they will turn left, pull forward toward the Falcon Field
gate, and have students exit on the passenger side. Parents will exit the lot using the 3rd exit on to St. Anthony St.

[Page 29]
Student Parking
Students will be able to use Milneburg Rd. to park in the Human Performance Center (HPC) lot closest to Leon C. Simon Dr. or The
International Center. See yellow Xs in the maps below. Students must secure a UNO decal to park in these locations.
Parking Permits: To obtain a UNO parking decal students must show: a valid driver’s license, vehicle registration and proof of
insurance, and pay the $25.00 per vehicle application fee.

[Page 30]
Additional Student Parking @ Hynes UNO Charter for Franklin Seniors
There are 52 available spots at Hynes UNO Charter for Franklin seniors indicated by the gold X on the map. Seniors will be able to park
in this lot on a first come, first served basis. Students who will use the Hynes UNO parking lot must secure a Franklin decal from our
security desk. Student drivers are asked to be courteous, obey all traffic signage, and be aware of kindergarten - 5th grade students who
will be entering Hynes UNO’s campus via their carpool lines. Suggested speed limit is 15 mph. Seniors are not allowed to visit their
vehicles at lunch. Seniors will lose the privilege of parking in this lot if they do not comply with Franklin’s standards
for being a good neighbor to Hynes UNO Charter.
Students Parking While Using University of New Orleans Facilities
Students who are assigned classes in UNO buildings, or who are using the UNO library, must park in the parking lot designated for students in
front of the HPC building or International Center and walk to campus buildings.
Student Parking Regulations
1. All student cars parked in the designated UNO lots must have a current UNO Parking Tag clearly displayed in the lower right part of the
rear window on the passenger’s side. Only that tag location is valid.
2. UNO police require students park their vehicles headed into a marked space. Do not back into the parking space.
3. Do not use the faculty lot adjacent to the gym. Student parking is assigned to UNO’s Human Performance Center (HPC) parking lot or
International Center parking lot (see student parking lot maps below). Parking in the lot in the front of the building is for short-term (up to
thirty minutes) visitors; and all of the side lot is for faculty and staff. You risk losing your parking privileges and having your car towed at
your expense for parking in these locations.
4. Cars are off limits to all students during the school day.
5. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in loss of student parking privileges, other school penalties, and/or a costly ticket issued by the
UNO Campus Police, and/or towing of the vehicle. We will regard the subsequent fine as a financial obligation to the school.

[Page 31]
Parents and Authorized Visitors
Parking: When you visit the school as a volunteer or long-term visitor, please park in a visitor spot. There are visitor spots in the front of the
school as well as in the faculty/staff parking lot.
Visitor’s Pass: Anyone visiting the school during the school day will register in the main office and receive a visitor’s pass or badge. This will
clearly identify you as a visitor to the school and not a trespasser.
STUDENTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO BRING VISITORS TO SCHOOL
We do not allow students to invite guests for the lunch hour or any other period of the school day. All outsiders on campus who do not wear a
visitor’s badge will be reported to Security immediately.
Trespassers: Be aware of any people whom you do not recognize as being students, faculty, or staff. Report their presence to the nearest staff
member. Legitimate visitors will be wearing a visitor’s identification badge and all regular students and staff will be wearing their ID badges.
Wear your school ID at all times.
Be aware of your surroundings coming from and going to your cars. Cars parked on the street and in our parking lots are vulnerable to theft.
These are not good locations to leave a car with an expensive stereo, car phone, or other personal items in it. Take similar precautions to
those you would use in any urban environment. Thieves know that there are cars parked unattended on and near the UNO campus for long
periods of time. Don’t make it easy for them to appropriate your property. Do not leave valuables out in plain sight in the vehicle.
If you do discover a theft or damage to your car or you discover any missing property, please report it promptly to the security desk for the
student to file a security report.
TECHNOLOGY
Use of school computers, devices, network, the Internet, and wireless system is a
privilege, not a right. Inappropriate use may result in loss of these privileges.
Network/computers are defined as any and all components of the school’s electronic
equipment, peripherals, software, and accessories used to provide computer resources
to the campus community.
CIPA
The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by Congress. This
law mandates that schools and libraries have electronic filters to prevent children from
accessing and viewing inappropriate Internet content. Franklin has multiple protections in place and is in compliance with CIPA regulations.
Network/Computer Guidelines
Educational Purpose
Access to the school network/computers is for school related purposes such as classroom activities, career development, school related events
and other school relevant work. The school has the right to view and/or restrict the material accessed or posted through the system. There is no
expectation of privacy on the school network/computers.
Student Behavior:
● SHALL NOT attempt to gain unauthorized access to the school network/computers/resources or try to gain access to another person’s
files/accounts.
● SHALL NOT attempt to disrupt the school network/computers/resources, destroy data by spreading computer viruses or by other
means.
● SHALL NOT use the school network/computers to engage in any illegal acts or activities that cause unreasonable disruption.

[Page 32]
● SHALL NOT give out Personally Identifiable Information of others online (“doxxing”).
● SHALL NOT engage in activities that initiate or participate in any activities that are prohibited by local, state or federal laws.
● SHALL NOT use the school network/computers to send or receive messages that discriminate against others or are obscene, profane,
lewd, vulgar, rude, inflammatory, threatening, intimidating, disrespectful, discriminating, or harassing.
● SHALL NOT access material that is profane, obscene, pornographic, illegal, violent, or discriminatory.
● SHALL NOT participate in any activities that can be construed as cyberbullying.
● SHALL immediately report any activities about which they become aware that can be construed as cyberbullying of other students,
faculty, staff, or community members in or out of the school network.
System Security
● Students are responsible for their individual accounts and files. Under no conditions will students provide their password to another
person. Sharing of access is prohibited.
● Students will immediately notify their teachers and/or the IT Department if they have identified a possible security problem.
Remote Learning
During periods of remote learning as necessitated by public health concerns, emergency orders, or any other reason deemed necessary by the
CEO or Principal, students must continue to abide by the Student Handbook.
By participating in remote learning, the parent/guardian understands and agrees that their child’s image and voice may be transmitted over the
internet and that the school cannot guarantee or warrant confidentiality of such. Students’ voices/images may be heard/viewed by school staff
members conducting or supervising remote/online services, other students participating in their remote learning cohort, and by any other
individuals who may be present in the location in which another student is participating in the remote/online service.
Unauthorized recording by a parent or student of remote/online services provided by or through the school and/or the dissemination of such
recording is a violation of this policy and may result in a referral to law enforcement authorities and the potential issuance of criminal charges.
1-1 Chromebook Program
Incoming students will be issued a Chromebook for their 4 years at school. Refer to the 1-to-1 Chromebook Program FAQ for further information.
Student Devices
All students have school-issued Chromebooks and are expected to bring their fully-charged device to school every day. The BFHS IT Department
does not lend out chargers; we have two no-cost charging lockers available onsite for use.
Outside of this, students may be permitted to utilize their own device at school and during school-related educational activities to assist and
enhance their learning experiences, subject to the terms of this policy, at the discretion of their teacher. Personal devices must comply with this
policy and Louisiana state law.
Getting Help
Students should email help@bfhsla.org at any time to create a ticket. Students are welcome to stop by room 229 for assistance. BFHS IT staff
may provide best-effort support for non-school-owned devices; however, the school is not responsible for personal equipment.
Printing
Students are provided with a limited printing credit and they may print from their personal devices or a school-issued device. If additional credit
is required for school work, students should put in a ticket by emailing help@bfhsla.org.
Device Checkout
Students are welcome to check out Chromebooks from the IT Department.
● Students are responsible for the care, maintenance, and security of the equipment, including damage and/or replacement costs.

[Page 33]
● Equipment must be returned in the same condition as when it was checked out. Items that are returned broken or are not returned will
be subject to a Broken/Lost Fee.
● Failure to return equipment within the specified due date may result in a student’s computer access being restricted and a suspension of
their Google Account.
● We have a limited number of hotspots available for students in need. Students requesting a hotspot will need the school financial
assistance form completed by a parent/guardian.
AI Policy
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence like
understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions, or generating content. These are powerful resources that can enhance learning,
creativity, and productivity when used with care and intention. A few examples include ChatGPT, AI image generators, Grammarly, Google
summaries with Gemini, and recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube or Spotify. There are also many concerns with AI use, such as
bias, hallucinations, energy use, and academic dishonesty. As AI is changing rapidly, some of the policies in this handbook will remain linked to
live documents.
Students must follow each teacher's policy on AI use in class as found in the teacher’s syllabus. These may change for each assignment, so be sure
to check with your teacher. Generative AI must not be used without explicit permission from a teacher, and all generative AI use must be cited or
noted on any school assignment.
Students should not use school wifi, school devices, or other school property for other AI use unless they have obtained specific permission. If a
student feels an AI tool should be unblocked for use, they should research the tool and fill out this form. Unapproved AI tools should not be used
with personal devices while at school during school hours.
Parents and guardians may have their own concerns about AI use, and we encourage families to discuss what is acceptable AI use.
Examples of unacceptable uses of AI include, but are not limited to:
● Plagiarism or Dishonesty: Copying AI-generated work and submitting it as your own, using AI to answer quiz/test questions, using AI
without citing it
● Bypassing Learning: Using AI to complete homework without attempting it yourself, submitting AI work without understanding the
content
● Inappropriate Content: Asking AI to generate harmful, violent, or offensive material, using AI to create or share misleading or fake
content
● Privacy Violations: Uploading other people's photos, names, or private information into AI tools, using AI tools that collect or share
personal data without consent
Consequences of AI misuse
AI violations may fall under inappropriate behavior, bullying or cyberbullying, or academic dishonesty and will follow those plans for consequences.
Data and Information Policies
Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) - The school is required to filter internet access for inappropriate content, monitor the internet usage of
minors, and provide education to students and staff on safe and appropriate online behavior. All school internet is filtered and the school conducts
yearly education of safe internet practices.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) - The FERPA law protects the privacy, accuracy, and release of information for students and
families of the school. Personal information stored or transmitted by agents of the school must abide by FERPA laws and the BFHS is required to
protect the integrity and security of student and family information. BFHS ensures that all data systems used by the school are FERPA compliant.
Annually, families are notified of their FERPA Rights and provided the opportunity to opt-out of information sharing.
Act 837 Consent is collected from families at the beginning of each school year and specifies ways in which your child’s personally identifiable
information is protected.

FEE ASSESSMENT AND PAYMENT
TRANSLATION SERVICES
Notice of Interpretation and Translation Services for Limited English Proficient Parents/ Guardians
The school recognizes that both communication and partnership with parents and guardians are vital for the educational success of students.
The district is committed to provide quality and professional translation (written) and interpretation (oral) services to families so that they can
take an active role in their children’s education.
To request an interpreter of a spoken language or translation of a school document, please contact the main office at your school. School staff
will use site-based resources to fulfill the request or the District’s Office of Federal Programs will be contacted to provide additional
interpretation or translation resources as requested which are available free of charge. If you need more information about interpretation and
translation services, please contact your child’s counselor or Communications Coordinator Eve Peyton at epeyton@bfhsla.org.
[Translation sections omitted for brevity but understood to be present]
COMPLAINTS & APPEALS POLICY
When there is a concern with a teacher or particular class, the first step toward resolution is to meet with the teacher. If that does not bring a
resolution, the next step is to meet with an assistant principal.
There are two independent policies of which students should be aware:
● Title IX Policy and Procedures
● Diversity Equity and Inclusion Policy and Procedures
They will determine the urgency of the matter and will respond accordingly. However, there must be an attempt to resolve the complaint within
five (5) school days.

[Page 35]
If, however, the complaint is against a member of the administration, the concern should be placed in writing and sent to the Principal.
The Principal will meet with the aggrieved party within ten (10) school days of receiving the complaint. A response from the Principal will be
placed in writing within 72 hours after the meeting. An unsatisfactory response from the Principal can be appealed to the CEO.
Such an appeal must be made to the CEO within five (5) days following the response from the Principal. The CEO will act on the matter.
All correspondence should be sent to the school’s address and addressed to the person from whom a response is requested.
